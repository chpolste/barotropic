# barotropic

Integrate the barotropic PV equation on the sphere.
Fields are represented on a regular latitude-longitude grid while spatial derivatives are evaluated in spectral space (spherical harmonics).
The model uses a leapfrog time integration scheme with Robert-Asselin filter, initialized with an Euler-forward step.


## Features

- Initial condition and forcing presets for atmospheric science experiments
- A range of diagnostic functions to investigate properties of the flow
- Predefined plotting functions

The model code is object-oriented, modular and easy to use.
The implementations are kept simple but sufficiently fast to allow interactive use at moderate spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g. 2.5Â° spatial resolution with 10 minute timesteps).
A simulation can be set up, run and visualized in under 10 lines of code, e.g.:

```python
import barotropic as bt

grid    = bt.Grid(resolution=2.5)
initial = bt.init.solid_body_rotation(grid, amplitude=15)
forcing = bt.rhs.GaussianMountain(center=(30, 45), stdev=(10, 10), height=2000)
model   = bt.BarotropicModel(forcing, diffusion_order=2)

last, all_states = model.run(initial, 15*bt.MIN, 10*bt.DAY, save_every=6*bt.HOUR)

last.plot.summary()
```

- Consult the [online documentation](https://chpolste.github.io/barotropic/docs/barotropic) to learn about the public interface.
- A few [example notebooks](examples) are provided in which the module is used to reproduce results from research papers.


## Dependencies

- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- [pyspharm](https://github.com/jswhit/pyspharm)

Additional dependencies for plotting, diagnostics, etc.:

- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
- [PyWavelets](https://github.com/PyWavelets/pywt) (>= 1.1)
- [hn2016_falwa](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa)

These are imported on demand and not required to just run the model.


## Installation

Installation as a package requires [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/).
From the root directory of the repository run

    pip install .

Optional dependencies are specified as an [extra](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies) and can be turned into required dependencies by installing with

    pip install .[with-optional]
