Features
========

- Integration of the barotropic PV equation on the sphere. 
  Fields are represented on a regular latitude-longitude grid while spatial derivatives are evaluated in spectral space (spherical harmonics).
  The model uses a leapfrog time integration scheme with Robert-Asselin filter, initialized with an Euler-forward step.
- A range of diagnostic functions to investigate properties of the flow and extract features, e.g. Rossby wave packets.
- Predefined plotting functions, initial condition presets and forcing terms.

The package is object-oriented, modular and easy to use.
The implementations are kept simple but sufficiently fast to allow interactive use at moderate spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g. 2.5Â° spatial resolution with 10 minute timesteps).
A simulation can be set up, run and visualized in under 10 lines of code, e.g.:

.. code::
   python

   import barotropic as bt
   
   grid    = bt.Grid(resolution=2.5)
   initial = bt.init.solid_body_rotation(grid, amplitude=15)
   forcing = bt.rhs.GaussianMountain(center=(30, 45), stdev=(10, 10), height=2000)
   model   = bt.BarotropicModel(forcing, diffusion_order=2)
   
   last, all_states = model.run(initial, 15*bt.MIN, 10*bt.DAY, save_every=6*bt.HOUR)
   
   last.plot.summary()
