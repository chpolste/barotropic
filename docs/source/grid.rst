Model Grid
==========

The :py:class:`.Grid` class encapsulates all functionality related to the spatial discretization of the sphere.
It provides access to coordinates, transformations between grid and spectral space, derivatives, quadrature, differential equation solvers, filtering, interpolation and a few other routines.
Creating a :py:class:`.Grid` is usually the first thing to do after importing :py:mod:`barotropic`.
